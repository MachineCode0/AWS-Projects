# Hosting a Smart Static Website on AWS
This projects will be divided into three main parts:
1. The problem it address.
2. How to actually build it.
3. The business impact.

## 1. The Problem It Addresses
As part of my project, I aimed to host a static website for Phelyx Communication that is:
	* Globally Accessible:
Ensuring fast load times for users worldwide.
	* Secure:
 Protecting the website from common web exploits and ensuring data is transmitted securely.

 	* Cost-Effective:
 Keeping hosting costs low while maintaining high availability and scalability.

This project addresses these challenges by leveraging AWS services like S3, CloudFront, ACM, WAF, and CloudWatch to create a robust, secure, and scalable hosting solution tailored to your needs.
